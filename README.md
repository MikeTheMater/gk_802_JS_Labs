# gk_802_JS_Labs
This is a repo that has the requirements that where asked during labs about JavaSctript. 
Lab 4 was more about CSS, we were given one HTML file that was simulating a note checkbox, we wanted the css file so that it looked like the 2 images.
We also wanted to add with JS the counter of the total notes and the box that were marked as done.

Lab 5 will come on Monday
